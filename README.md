MusicDL is an app for downloading music directly from services like Youtube, zaycev.net, mail.ru and others. I made it for practicing a few skills I have learnt about scraping the web and tools like python's beautifulsoup library, plus all of the new stuff provided with Python 3.

## Requirements

See the requirements.txt, located in the root of this repository. Additionally, take into account the following.

## running

Run the file main.py, located in the src directory.

## Building

I have provided a setup.py file for cx_freeze, so you should be able to do something like:

> python setup.py build

And start building. Check the dist folder for results.
